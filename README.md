### SUMMARY


In this project, we processed the data.csv and labels.csv files, created test and train sections, and we apply Multi-Layer Perceptron to these sections including the clustering quality measures given below. In this process we used scikit-learnâ€™s NN module for Python programming language. The code calculated regarding metrics as following formulas: (TP = True Positive, TN = True Negative, FP = False Positive, FN = False Negative)

Metrics:

- Precision=TP/(TP+FP) 
- Recall=TP/(TP+FN) 
- F2 Score=(5 x precision x recall)/(4 x precision+recall)
